# Team API template

A template for defining a Team API. A Team API is a description and specification that a team can define that tells others how to interact with that team.

Based on some of the ideas in the book _Team Topologies_ by Matthew Skelton [@matthewskelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) and Manuel Pais [@manupaisable](https://github.com/manupaisable). See pages 47-49 of the book _Team Topologies_.

## Overview

It can be useful to define a "Team API" for each team, to improve the team's clarity of purpose and help other groups understand how that team fits into the broader organization. Use this template to help teams think about how they would define their Team API.
